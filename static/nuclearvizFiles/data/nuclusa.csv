The information required for this notification is provided below:  ""(i) Name and address of the individual or individuals informing the Commission.  William Brunet Director of Quality Assurance James White General Manager Target Rock, Business Unit of Curtiss-Wright Flow Control Corporation 1966E Broadhollow Road East Farmingdale, NY 11735  ""(ii) Identification of the basic component supplied for such facility or such activity within the United States which may fail to comply or contains a potential defect.  Target Rock 0867F Series of Main Steam-Safety Relief Valves Manufactured by Target Rock. This is a 3-stage piloted valve consisting of a main valve (the 'Main') with an actuator mounted to it (the 'Topworks'). The 0867F is the latest generation of the 67F line of MS-SRVs, including the original 3-Stage and 2-Stage designs, and this product line has over 40 years of plant operational experience. Only the 0867F is under investigation. This is due to the differences between the 0867F design and the other designs.  ""(iii) Identification of the firm supplying the basic component which fails to comply or contains a defect.  Target Rock, Business Unit of Curtiss-Wright Flow Control Corporation 1966E Broadhollow Road East Farmingdale, NY 11735  ""(iv) Nature of the defect or failure to comply and the safety hazard which is created or could be created by such defect or failure to comply.  As we understand it, the Pilgrim Station recently manually opened the Target Rock Main Steam Safety Relief Valves (MS-SRVs) as part of cooling down the reactor following a loss of offsite power. One of the four installed MS-SRVs may not have fully opened. As-found steam testing of the affected MS-SRV did not duplicate this failure; the valve opened on demand. However, the valve did not re-close as expected. Internal inspections found damaged parts in the main stage subassembly that could potentially affect the ability of the MS-SRV to operate as designed.  We are investigating potential root causes for this damage. However, we are still unable to determine if a specific defect exists. GE SIL-196, Supplement 17 determined Main Spring relaxation was caused by 'extreme dynamics encountered during limited flow testing  . Valve dynamics under full flow conditions (i.e. discharge not gagged) are much less severe than those under limited flow conditions.' These extreme dynamics, under limited flow test conditions, are the focus of our investigation. Specific areas of investigation include;  a) Testing of materials to verify they are consistent with our material specifications, b) evaluation of differences between the 0867F and earlier designs, and c) evaluation of the differences between different limited flow test loop configurations and test procedures  ""(v) The date on which the information of such defect or failure to comply was obtained.  The Pilgrim event occurred on January 27, 2015. As-found testing occurred on February 2, 2015.  ""(vi) In the case of a basic component which contains a defect or fails to comply, the number and location of these components in use at, supplied for, being supplied for, or may be supplied for, manufactured, or being manufactured for one or more facilities or activities subject to the regulations in this part.  While we have yet to determine if a specific defect exists, the following plants were supplied 0867F MS-SRVs:  - Pilgrim (Model 09J-001) Quantity Shipped = 8 - Fitzpatrick (Model 09H-001) Quantity Shipped = 4, Quantity on order= 8 - Hatch 1 and 2 (Model 09G-001) Quantity Shipped= 24, Quantity on order= 12  The following plants will be supplied 0867F MS-SRVs:  - Hope Creek (Models 14J-001, 14J-002) Quantity on order = 7  ""(vii) The corrective action which has been, is being, or will be taken; the name of the individual or organization responsible for the action; and the length of time that has been or will be taken to complete the action.  The root cause of the potential test induced defect has not yet been confirmed as of the date of this report. Therefore, no specific corrective actions have been initiated. Target Rock Problem Report 080 will document the corrective actions when they are determined and complete the 10 CFR Part 21 evaluation of the potential test induced defect. This determination will be based on further mechanical and material evaluations. TR anticipates completing these evaluations within 45 days; however, in the event the evaluations are not completed, TR will forward another interim report within 45 days.  ""(viii) Any advice related to the defect or failure to comply about the facility, activity, or basic component that has been, is being, or will be given to purchasers or licensees.  We are working with all three (4) sites to identify appropriate precautions.  ""(ix) In the case of an early site permit, the entities to whom an early site permit was transferred.  Not applicable.

""The revision of the procedure in use at the time had inadvertently included acceptance criterion for fan air flow in the monthly supplements.  The monthly tests demonstrate the flow paths for the two trains are functional and open, but they are not performed in the designed Engineered Safeguards (ES) configuration. The monthly tests do not secure the normal supply and exhaust ventilation within the penetration room boundaries; therefore, flow may be outside limits required during the ES configuration.  The 18 month surveillance, which measures the flowrate of the system while in the ES configuration, was completed in April 2016.  The surveillance verified the system's operability.  The systems have not been modified or altered since this surveillance; therefore the measured flowrate remains the same.  ""The procedure has been revised subsequent to this event to remove the flowrate as an 'acceptance criterion' for the monthly test.

A nominal dose of 30 milliCi in capsule form was given to a child within the nuclear medicine department of the licensee's facility.  Although the patient was being treated on an outpatient basis, the licensee was keeping the patient for a short time to ensure there would be no complications before being sent home.  During this period, staff checked in on the patient several times and during one of the visits, discovered that rather than swallowing the capsule as instructed, the patient had spit the capsule out into their hand and was hiding the capsule.  This resulted in extensive contamination of the patient's hand, clothing and the chair they were sitting in as well as the immediate surrounding area.  During the process to evaluate and decontaminate the patient, additional contamination was discovered in adjacent camera rooms and corridors where the staff had traversed.  Staff moved to close the department and restrict passage into/out of the nearby areas to prevent additional spread of contamination.  Initial estimates suggest that the patient ingested little if any of the activity and that excessive levels were throughout the area of the nuclear medicine department.  Based on this finding, barriers were erected and the department was closed for over 48 hours while assessment and decontamination efforts were ongoing.   ""Agency inspectors were at the site on January 26 to perform assessments of exposure, contamination levels, potential uptake by staff and corrective action being taken by the licensee.  This matter will remain open while those assessments are on going.  Initial bioassay results suggest only negligible uptakes have occurred with staff.  Potential exposures/uptakes continue to be evaluated by the licensee throughout the decontamination process.

Removing the inverter from service caused a loss of the associated 120 VAC instrument  buss. This instrument buss loss caused a trip of the Division 1 Control Building Chill Water and Ventilation system.

F for 2.80 hours or greater with no operator actions required. The 2.8 hours is based on the switchgear room inverters operating which is bounding for the case where the DC equipment room inverters are operating. The 122 deg.

Specifically, affected equipment refers to the 3"" style HPNS valve body for next-generation nuclear plants and its associated cage and plug retainer.  ""Purpose: The purpose of this FIN is to alert affected customers that, as of 2 January 2017, Fisher Controls International LLC (Fisher) became aware of a situation which may affect the performance of the aforementioned equipment, including its safety-related function. Fisher is informing affected customers of this circumstance in accordance with Section 21.21(b) of 10 CFR 21.  ""Applicability: This FIN applies only to the equipment identified in Appendix A, which lists serial numbers and order numbers that were delivered to customers. Specifically, it applies to the Fisher 3  style HPNS valve body assembly, sold to AP1000 next generation plant sites, Commodity Package PV14, Datasheet 111.  ""Discussion: During plant hot functional testing, certain valve assemblies did not achieve full travel. Upon disassembly, site inspection found wear between the cage and plug retainer in some valves. Vertical scratches in the cage internal diameter and plug retainer outside diameter was confirmation of galling which prohibited full travel. In one valve, the cage could not be removed from the body as it was friction-welded due to galling.  ""The valve body-to-cage interference is attributed to body-to-bonnet gasket compression which caused the valve body gasket groove to distort/yield, particularly the cage guide internal diameter bore. Regarding the cage-to-plug retainer binding, thermal expansion calculations between cage internal diameter and plug retainer outside diameter indicate an undersized diametrical clearance at temperature.  ""Extent of Condition: In addition to the equipment listed in Appendix A, all other style HPNS designs (NPS 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) were examined for extent of condition. Results indicate that DS111 was a lone outlier and this issue is not expected to occur for the other sizes, material combinations and datasheets sold into their respective applications and temperatures. Arrangements have been made with the customers to replace or maintenance the trim for the equipment listed in Appendix A. In addition, a Corrective Action Request (CAR 1817) has been initiated by Fisher to prevent reoccurrence of this issue.  ""10 CFR 21 Implications: Fisher requests that the recipient of this FIN review it and take appropriate action in accordance with 10 CFR 21.

""On December 15, 2016 at 1332 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Unit 2 maintenance personnel were preparing to perform a breaker swap for the normal feed to the 2B1B C and A vent board. When the power was removed from Radiation Monitor 2-RM-90-131, the B Train master isolation signal status panel was unexpectedly lit for CVI. The only automatic action observed from the containment isolation status panel was that 2-FCV-30-037, Lower Compartment Purge Control valve, went closed. The loss of power to 2-RM-90-131 de-energized the relay associated with the high radiation setpoint, resulting in an invalid Train B CVI actuation.  ""During this event, the train B CVI actuation was complete and equipment functioned as designed. Upon identification of the Train B CVI, maintenance activities were halted and a prompt investigation was initiated. WBN found that the work order to perform the breaker swap was planned to lift leads to disable actuation of CVI. The work order lifted the lead for the K622 relay, which was insufficient to prevent the actuation. Two other leads on relays should have been lifted to prevent the actuation in Mode 1. A contributor to this error was that this work had been rescheduled several times prior to actual performance.

It was determined that the device had unintentionally been removed from a machine during maintenance work at Bemis Company, Inc. and that it was then grouped with scrap metal before being transported to Alter Trading.  While the shutter was open, the time spent around the device by any employees or members of the public, or employees of either Bemis or Alter, is believed to be minimal.  The shutter has been closed, and wipe tests confirm that there is no removable contamination.  There are no known or suspected overexposures resulting from this incident.  Bemis is working with a service provider to arrange for packaging and transportation of the gauge back to their facility.

The source was packaged to prevent contamination and then isolated for pending disposal.  It was also determined that the actual breach of the source occurred on 2/11/2017.  Given the lapse of when the source was compromised and when Duke Radiation Safety Office was notified it is apparent that established Duke SOPs were not followed.  Duke personnel and researchers believed to have been exposed to the leaking source had lung scans performed on 2/15/2017, in which all came back indicating no exposure.  Duke personnel accompanied by NCRPS staff began testing for contamination of the affected area and surrounding areas due to the compromised source.   ""On 2/16/2017, Duke personnel again notified NCRPS that contamination was discovered outside of the anticipated areas where contamination was suspected.  On 2/16/2017, NCRPS personnel continued the reactive inspection. The scope to the surveys was expanded to now cover high traffic areas, vehicles of the individuals involved, bathrooms and other areas where potential contamination from the leaking source may have been in.  Testing of these areas for contamination is ongoing at the time of this report.  For the identified personnel directly associated with the leaking source, surveys and wipes were expanded to their residences.  One residence, that of a Duke Physicist Researcher, presented contamination on a toilet seat which was decontaminated and re-surveyed and re-wiped and the results confirmed the decontamination.  Other areas of the residence were surveyed and at the time of this report all results indicate no further contamination.  Additional researchers identified on 2/16/17 to have been involved with the leaking source, were also scheduled to have lung scans on 2/17/2017.  Additionally, Duke University decided to compound testing to include urinalysis and possibly bloodwork at the advice of REACTS.  At this time, it is believed that contamination due to the leaking source has been contained and no members of the public have received radiation exposures.  To date, the highest reading in proximity to the source on Duke University's property was 7000 CPM and 4280 DPM.   ""On 2/17/2017, NCRPS in conjunction with Duke personnel reconvened to continue to complete the expanded surveys and wipes of all possible suspected areas and to conduct additional interviews with Duke personnel to rule out any chances of additional affected persons.  Currently, this is an ongoing investigation and this event will be updated as additional details are received.""  North Carolina Event Report 2/17/2017."

""At approximately 0715 on February 23, 2017, Solutions Management was notified by a Radiation Protection Technician (RPT) that the containment berm of the East (immediately north of Turbine Building) Baker Tank (20,000 gallon storage tank) was full and spilling out of the containment berm. The water that spilled out of the containment berm had pooled to the north of the tank and eventually began draining into the Radiological Controlled Area (RCA) storm sewer drain.   ""Upon discovery and initial investigation the RPT ascertained that a sump pump hose which was left in the tank overnight was siphoning into the containment berm. The RPT immediately removed the hose from the water in the Baker Tank to stop the water from siphoning. Once the water was secured actions were taken [to minimize the contamination].  ""Approximately 400 gallons had been lost from the tank. The 400 gallons was siphoned from the tank through a garden hose attached to a sump pump which was sitting in the containment berm. Over the course of approximately 16 hours the water siphoning from the tank filled the containment berm which holds a little over 3,100 gallons and spilled on to an asphalt surface. The water then traveled approximately 30 feet over the asphalt surface to the storm sewer which contained inlet protection in accordance with the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. After filtering through the inlet protection the water remained in the storm water drain until the volume was sufficient enough to reach the 10 inch discharge piping (approximately 12 inches).  The water traveled approximately 100 feet to the next storm water drain where it remained until the volume was sufficient enough to reach the 10 inch discharge piping (approximately 8 inches). When the manhole was opened, the level of the water was just above the bottom of the 10 inch discharge piping and was flowing slowly. The water leaving the 10 inch discharge piping flowed to a 60 inch discharge pipe that discharges to the Mississippi River.

Although the concentration levels exceed the 10CFR20 Table 2 limits for effluents (water) for Cs-137 they did not exceed the criteria for reportability which is 20 times the Table 2 effluent limit for Cs-137. The smear surveys of the storm sewer piping, manhole vaults taken during entries into the RCA yard drain & Administration Building drain manholes were all considerably less than CA posting criteria. The Standard Dose Calculations used for planned water releases were utilized for the water release assuming no dilution. Using the Standard Dose Calculations it was calculated that 1.05 E-02 mRem was the worst case for organs and 5.72E-03 mRem for total body dose.  ""Following the RPM's review, it was determined that the asphalt area of the RCA could be down posted as a CA and the storm drain vault to the north of the Administration Building could be unplugged to allow regular flow of storm water.  ""Solution's has issued a Conditions Report (CR) and initiated an investigation to prevent this occurrence from happening again.  ""Regulatory reportability limits for liquid effluent releases were not exceed as result of this event."""

As a result of the voltage transient, the Division 1 Fuel Building ventilation (VF) system isolation dampers closed causing a trip of VF supply and exhaust fans.  With no running VF fans, secondary containment differential pressure rose to slightly greater than 0 inches water gauge which exceeded the Technical Specification requirement of greater than 0.25 inches vacuum water gauge.  The Control Room entered EOP-8, Secondary Containment Control.  This event is being reported as a Condition that Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function under 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(v)(C).

The identified discoloration and corrosion was not present at the completion of fabrication and became evident when pulled from stock in July of 2016. It was determined that the fabrication process was changed during fabrication of the April of 2015 items to utilize a different vendor for fabrication activities. Evaluation of the fabrication process performed on the subject items identified that this new vendor utilized a polishing process that was not performed on previously fabricated items. Particles/crystals from the discolored areas of the affect items were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) method and it was identified that ammonium phosphate crystals had formed on the items. It is the determination of UCI that the affected items were cleaned/polished with unknown chemicals during the polishing process of fabrication that resulted in the formation of these crystals and degradation of the enclosure material overtime.  The items manufactured utilizing this new process were supplied to Clyde Union Limited under purchase orders 4500109863/4 (Qty. 1) and 4500113688/4 (Qty. 1). Clyde Union Limited was notified of the subject issue on January 13, 2017 and UCI is awaiting concurrence from Clyde Union Limited that the affected items are to be returned for replacement items manufactured per the original manufacturing process.
